### 0.23.0
Incredibly new features!

Now, we can use object storage (MinIO, S3, R2 or anything you like) for synchronising! Moreover, despite that, we can use all the features as if we were using CouchDB.
Note: As this is a pretty experimental feature, hence we have some limitations.
- This is built on the append-only architecture. It will not shrink used storage if we do not perform a rebuild.
- A bit fragile. However, our version x.yy.0 is always so.
- When the first synchronisation, the entire history to date is transferred. For this reason, it is preferable to do this under the WiFi network.
- Do not worry, from the second synchronisation, we always transfer only differences.

I hope this feature empowers users to maintain independence and self-host their data, offering an alternative for those who prefer to manage their own storage solutions and avoid being stuck on the right side of a sudden change in business model.

Of course, I use Self-Hosted MinIO for testing and recommend this. It is for the same reason as using CouchDB. -- open, controllable, auditable and indeed already audited by numerous eyes.

Let me write one more acknowledgement.

I have a lot of respect for that plugin, even though it is sometimes treated as if it is a competitor, remotely-save. I think it is a great architecture that embodies a different approach to my approach of recreating history. This time, with all due respect, I have used some of its code as a reference.
Hooray for open source, and generous licences, and the sharing of knowledge by experts.

  - Fixed:
    - Sending chunks on `Send chunk in bulk` are now buffered to avoid the out-of-memory error.
    - `Send chunk in bulk` is back to default disabled. (Sorry, not applied to the migrated users; I did not think we should deepen the wound any further "automatically").

### 0.22.0
A few years passed since Self-Hosted LiveSync was born, and our codebase had been very complicated. This could be patient now, but it should be a tremendous hurt.
Therefore at v0.22.0, for future maintainability, I refined task scheduling logic totally.

Of course, I think this would be our suffering in some cases. However, I would love to ask you for your cooperation and contribution.

Sorry for being absent so much long. And thank you for your patience!

Note: we got a very performance improvement.
Note at 0.22.2: **Now, to rescue mobile devices, Maximum file size is set to 50 by default**. Please configure the limit as you need. If you do not want to limit the sizes, set zero manually, please.

### 0.21.0
The E2EE encryption V2 format has been reverted. That was probably the cause of the glitch.
Instead, to maintain efficiency, files are treated with Blob until just before saving. Along with this, the old-fashioned encryption format has also been discontinued.
There are both forward and backwards compatibilities, with recent versions. However, unfortunately, we lost compatibility with filesystem-livesync or some.
It will be addressed soon. Please be patient if you are using filesystem-livesync with E2EE.

    - Content change detection has been improved.

    - No longer files are broken while rebuilding.
    - Now, Large binary files can be written correctly on a mobile platform.
    - Any decoding errors now make zero-byte files.

    - All files are processed sequentially for each.
- 0.21.1
  - Fixed:
    - No more infinity loops on larger files.
    - Show message on decode error.

    - Now the saving files are processed by Blob.
    - The V2-Format has been reverted.
    - New encoding format has been enabled in default.
    - WARNING: Since this version, the compatibilities with older Filesystem LiveSync have been lost.

## 0.20.0
At 0.20.0, Self-Hosted LiveSync has changed the binary file format and encrypting format, for efficient synchronisation.  
The dialogue will be shown and asks us to decide whether to keep v1 or use v2. Once we have enabled v2, all subsequent edits will be saved in v2. Therefore, devices running 0.19 or below cannot understand this and they might say that decryption error. Please update all devices.  
Then we will have an impressive performance.

Of course, these are very impactful changes. If you have any questions or troubled things, please feel free to open an issue and mention me.

Note: if you want to roll it back to v1, please enable `Use binary and encryption version 1` on the `Hatch` pane and perform the `rebuild everything` once.

Extra but notable information:

This format change gives us the ability to detect some `marks` in the binary files as same as text files. Therefore, we can split binary files and some specific sort of them (i.e., PDF files) at the specific character. It means that editing the middle of files could be detected with marks.

Now only a few chunks are transferred, even if we add a comment to the PDF or put new files into the ZIP archives.

### 0.19.0

#### Customization sync

Since `Plugin and their settings` have been broken, so I tried to fix it, not just fix it, but fix it the way it should be.

Now, we have `Customization sync`.

It is a real shame that the compatibility between these features has been broken. However, this new feature is surely useful and I believe that worth getting over the pain.
We can use the new feature with the same configuration. Only the menu on the command palette has been changed. The dialog can be opened by `Show customization sync dialog`.

I hope you will give it a try.

### 0.18.0

#### Now, paths of files in the database can now be obfuscated. (Experimental Feature)
At before v0.18.0, Self-Hosted LiveSync used the path of files, to detect and resolve conflicts. In naive. The ID of the document stored in the CouchDB was naturally the filename.
However, it means a sort of lacking confidentiality. If the credentials of the database have been leaked, the attacker (or an innocent bystander) can read the path of files. So we could not use confidential things in the filename in some environments.
Since v0.18.0, they can be obfuscated. so it is no longer possible to decipher the path from the ID. Instead of that, it costs a bit CPU load than before, and the data structure has been changed a bit.

We can configure the `Path Obfuscation` in the `Remote database configuration` pane.  
Note: **When changing this configuration, we need to rebuild both of the local and the remote databases**.

#### Minors

- 0.18.4

  - Improved:
    - Actions for maintaining databases moved to the `🎛️Maintain databases`.

      - Be sure to fully all devices synchronised before perform it.
      - After cleaning up the remote, all devices will be locked out. If we are sure had it be synchronised, we can perform only cleaning-up locally. If not, we have to perform `Fetch`.

      - It let us free from conflict resolution on initial synchronising.
