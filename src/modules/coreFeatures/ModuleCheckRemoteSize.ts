> If you have been using it for many years, there may be unreferenced chunks - that is, garbage - accumulating in the database. Therefore, we recommend rebuilding everything. It will probably become much smaller.

Self-Hosted LiveSync does not delete the actual data even if you delete it to speed up the process. It is roughly [documented](https://github.com/vrtmrz/obsidian-livesync/blob/main/docs/tech_info.md).
